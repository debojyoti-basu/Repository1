// The File is the part of the project for Image based Localization for Self Driving Vehicles.
//Reference to the Challenge for developing image based localization and not rely solely on LIDAR or GPS
//for navigating the self driving vehicle.
//Image Processing Libraries like OpenCV needs to be used for processing the data frame acquired from
//image sensors.
